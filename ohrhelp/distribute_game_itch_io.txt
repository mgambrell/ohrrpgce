This option uploads your game directly to itch.io

You must create your itch.io account first. You will need to type your itch username, but the ohrrpgce never knows your password, that is handled with the browser.

First create a project for your game in the itch.io dashboard.

Game details and screenshots and options for selling or donating have to be set up in the itch.io website.


This menu will simply upload the latest version of your game to the project you have already set up in itch.io



= Experimental Web Build =


The web build is experimental. Currently, save slots are deleted when the browser window is closed.


You must change your project type from "Downloadable" to "HTML"


After the first time you have uploaded your game from this menu, you should mark gamename-web.zip as "this file will be played in the browser"
